MPG Exchange is a web based application that utilizes EPA API to retrieve data regarding fuel economy for Toyota models from 2021 to 2025. MPG Exchange utilizes object oriented concepts, aggregation, CORS, jackson library, springboot, nodejs, react js, JSON data, and rest controllers.
CORS is important to use due the different domains used in which the front end sends requests from a host url to the backend server. CORS allows for safe communication and security for the web browser, CORS also handls requests sent between the front and back end.
Jackson Library is important to use due to the JSON data recieved from the API, the Jackson Library allows us to create objects using the JSON data making it easier to comprehend and translate to string.
REST controller is useful due to the use of API and the ease of use in Spring boot.
Spring boot, nodeJS, reactJS and IntelliJ Idea were all used to create and develop MPG Exchange allowing use to create a web based application.
